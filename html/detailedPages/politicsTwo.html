        <h1>Atlanta massacre sparks a political awakening in the Korean church</h1>
        <hr>
        <div><img src="../../images/atlanta-suspect.jpg" alt="Picture of Atlanta Suspect">
            <p>
                DULUTH, Ga. — This month’s killing spree at Atlanta-area spas is pushing Korean American pastors to do 
                something quietly radical: Urge their flocks to get politically involved and rise up against racism 
                against Asian Americans.
            </p>
            <p>
                Political activism is normally off-limits in the evangelical Korean church. Pastors, many of them 
                immigrants themselves, firmly believe in separating church and state. Politics and protests, they say, 
                are secular matters that don’t belong in the sanctuary.
                But this month’s massacre, which killed eight people, four of whom were Korean, is animating the Korean 
                community here.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s spurring them to act in new ways — reminiscent of the Black church and the role it 
                played in the civil rights struggle. Religious leaders are at the forefront of this nascent movement, 
                agitating for change. And as they look to harness Korean American electoral power in the Atlanta suburbs, their turn toward activism could have lasting implications in a state roiled by rapid demographic upheaval.
                Churches can no longer stay silent about racism, said Pastor Han Byung-chul from the Korean Central 
                Presbyterian Church of Atlanta, who recently formed an anti-AAPI hate group in the city with 11 other 
                religious leaders.
            </p> 
            <p>
                “It should be a time that Asian Americans reflect on their indifference and irresponsibility,” Han said
                in an interview, using language striking for its rebuke of his fellow Asians. “This is an awakening 
                moment for Asian Americans.”
                Pastors are reluctant to align themselves with a party. And right now, their efforts are in the very 
                early planning stages. But they’re making it clear they intend to be a force strong enough to pressure 
                lawmakers and political parties into addressing the needs of the Asian American and Pacific Islander 
                community.
            </p>
            <p>
                “It’s not about specific politicians or political parties. We want an overarching understanding that we 
                need to create a society where immigrants and Asians aren’t discriminated [against]," said Pastor Lee 
                Jun-hyup from Immanuel Korean United Methodist Church in Marietta, Ga. “Korean churches and Asian 
                American groups will likely put more pressure on lawmakers to implement systematic changes to address 
                these issues.”
            </p>

                Michelle Au: 'Violence against Asian Americans is not new'.
                A similar political awakening is gaining momentum across the United States. Last week, Pastor Choi 
                Byung-ho, president of the National Caucus of Korean Presbyterian Churches, sent out instructions 
                encouraging pastors around the country to incorporate anti-racism messages in their sermons.
            </p>
            <p>
                Lew Jae-duk, the president of the Korean United Methodist churches, put out a statement that both 
                condemns hate crimes and criticizes xenophobic lawmakers: “I think politicians who have used Asians 
                as a scapegoat are partially to blame,” he said. “Because the country is struggling, they’re fueling 
                hate against immigrants, minorities and other countries to court the support of the far-right.”
                Ultimately these pastors say they want to work with lawmakers to enact policy change protecting Asian 
                Americans from further violence, said Pastor Michael Lee of All Nations Community Church in Bellevue, 
                Wash. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Law enforcement must improve both the way it tracks hate crimes and the way those crimes are 
                prosecuted, Lee said. But that can only happen by ensuring all police departments carry a hate crime 
                unit, which can help expedite the investigation of these incidents. He also emphasized the need for 
                oversight committees to monitor law enforcement's handling of hate crimes.
            </p>
            <p>
                “All this hype without policy change is just hype. It's just emotions,” Lee said. “And so I think the 
                only way to make lasting changes is through policy changes. Having a seat at the table with lawmakers, 
                with elected officials locally, statewide, nationally … that's absolutely essential.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Like other ethnic groups, Korean Americans often split along generational lines. First-generation 
                immigrants tend to align with conservatives on matters like abortion and the economy; many Korean 
                Americans, for instance, are small business owners who despise taxes and red tape. But younger 
                generations are more likely to tell pollsters that the Republican Party, dominated increasingly by 
                white identity politics, doesn’t represent them.  
            </p>
            <p>
                An invigorated Korean community, pushed to action by Korean churches, could be good news for Democrats, 
                who have been losing ground with the Korean community in recent years, according to early poll data. 
                Although nationally, 57 percent of Korean Americans said they would vote for Biden pre-election, an 
                exit poll conducted by the Asian American Legal Defense and Education Fund found that only 39 percent 
                voted for the current president. While the numbers are still incomplete, it shows that Democrats need 
                better outreach to the community to secure their vote in future elections.
            </p>
            <p>
                It’s why the current galvanizing around racism works in the Democrats’ favor because Korean Americans 
                approve their handling of the issue: In a September survey by AAPI Data, a demographic data and policy 
                research organization, 63 percent of Korean Americans said they thought Democrats did a better job at 
                addressing racism than Republicans — the highest rate out of all ethnicities polled and 14 percent above 
                the overall Asian American average.

                Warnock on Atlanta killings: ‘We know hate when we see it’
                What’s more, this spark in activism among pastors is bridging the generational gap in civic participation 
                for the community. Young second- and third-generation Korean Americans are mingling with older 
                first-generation immigrants at protests against racial discrimination. Korean culture is very family 
                focused, so this multigenerational approach will likely inspire older, first-generation immigrants to 
                stay engaged, activists say. And that, in turn, will likely translate to then having a united voice on 
                issues, fostering higher voter turnout.
            </p>
            <p>
                “That’s what it feels like for the Asian community: That finally, after all these years of being silenced
                and minimized and demonized, we have this window,” said Hyepin Im, president and founder of Faith and 
                Community Empowerment. “It feels like we’re finally given this platform for us to speak".
            </p>
            <p>
                Until now, these populations have shied away from speaking out about racial issues or even being a part of 
                political movements. Part of that is due to cultural and language barriers, as well as a deeply ingrained 
                belief that religion should not be a part of secular activities, such as politics or protests.
            </p>
            <p>
                But churches have long held a prominent role in fighting against racial injustice, especially within the 
                Black community. Black churches were the epicenter of the 60s civil rights movement — led by Martin 
                Luther King, Jr., the pastor of the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, and his network of fellow 
                preachers across the South — as they hosted community meetings, organized mass marches and provided 
                spiritual support.
            </p>
            <p>
                Korean churches today are following in that tradition, said Omar Wasow, a politics professor at Princeton 
                who tracks political movements. And he sees many of the same patterns playing out in the Korean community 
                today.
