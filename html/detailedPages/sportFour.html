            <h1>Osaka pulls out of Stuttgart Open</h1>
            <hr>
            <div><img src="../../images/osaka-naomi.jpg" alt="Naomi Osaka">
                <p>
                    Grand Slam champion Naomi Osaka has pulled out of next month’s Stuttgart Open after confessing to being homesick and unsure 
                    of long stretches on the road.
                </p> 
                <p>
                    Osaka, who is currently ranked the number two tennis female player in the world, withdrew from WTA clay-court competition 
                    which is set to begin April 17-15 in southwest Germany. The games serve as a build-up to the French Open that is scheduled 
                    to begin on May 23.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Organizers confirmed that she will begin the European season later in May. Osaka is fresh off her first Grand Slam title of 
                    2021 after she beat USA’s Jennifer Brady in the Australian Open final in January. However, she told reporters in Miami that 
                    there wasn’t a desire on her part to travel so much and play in as many tournaments, Yahoo News reported.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Well for me, I’m not really sure what a normal schedule is but I’ve never thought of myself as the player that would play 
                    week-in and week-out,” Osaka said. “I personally get homesick quite often and it makes me kinda sad sometimes.” “I would like 
                    to travel somewhere and focus on that tournament.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    The Japanese and Haitian superstar added that she’d be more selective in the games she chose to play in 2021.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “I’d love to just travel somewhere and just really focus on that tournament; for me that is something that I’ve learned works 
                    for me,” said Osaka.
                </p>
                <p>
                    “Hopefully it will work for me this time in Europe because my results there haven’t been that great, but I feel like every year 
                    I am on tour I learn more about myself and what type of schedule I like to play.”    
                </p>
                <p>
                    Being closer to home will allow Osaka, 23, to spend more time with her loved ones such as her boyfriend, rapper Cordae. Osaka 
                    shouted him out on Instagram on Thursday and posted a picture of them at the 2020 U.S. Open final.
