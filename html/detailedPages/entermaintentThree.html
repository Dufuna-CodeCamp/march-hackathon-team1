        <h1>Don Jazzy, others react to Callmiwhizzy’s new skit</h1>
        <hr>
        <div><img src="../../images/Callmiwhizzy.jpg" alt="Picture of Comedian CallMeWhizzy">
            <p>
                FAST-RISING comedian, Wisdom Osarinmwan Oamen aka Callmiwhizzy, has gotten the attention of top entertainment 
                industry giants such as Don Jazzy, Iyabo Ojo, Lasisi Elelenu, Koffithaguru, Samklef, Warri Pikin among others 
                with his recent skit.  
            </p>
            <p>
                The skit highlighted the travails of the Nigerian youth even after struggling to acquire a university degree and 
                the employment search still lingers on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Don Jazzy took to his Instagram page to upload the skit with the caption “This is so dope. Hard guy nearly cry sef 
                as I dey watch.”
                Other celebrities showed their support as well to comedian Callmiwhizzy.
            </p>
            <p>
                In an exclusive chat with The Nation on how he gained popularity, Callmiwhizzy thanked Lasisi Elendu and Tunde Ednut 
                for sharing his earliest videos.
            </p>

                The fashion design trainee said “I’m not done with school yet, I wrote my school certificate examination in 2015, 
                I was eager to further my education but I was discouraged by family members. After I left school, I decided to go 
                learn a trade selling medication in the village and later switched to fashion designing in Benin and I’ve been doing 
                that ever since.”
            </p>
            <p>
                When asked if his mum inspired his skits, he said “Maybe yes, I grew up with her till 2015 when I finally had to 
                leave to Benin for my WAEC.So I’m just used to her, used to the fact that I promised her I was going to be famous, 
                and it seems making skits with her name is part of my way of appreciating her.”
