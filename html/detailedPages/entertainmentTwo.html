                Alibaba says the reason Nigeria is a mess is that people who shouldn't be near political offices are making 
                policies for professionals.  
            </p>
            <p>
                Nigerian veteran comedian Atunyota Alleluya Akpobome also known as Alibaba, has berated the non-professionals 
                running the affairs of the country.
            </p>
            <p>
                In a lengthy post shared via his Instagram page on Friday, March 26, 2021, the comedian said the country is in a 
                mess because instead of the leaders to perform, they would rather bank on prayers.
            </p>
            <p>
                He went on to give instances of when professionalism rather than prayers can only give results.
