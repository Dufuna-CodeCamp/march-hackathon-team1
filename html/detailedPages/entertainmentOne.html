                    Kanye West's sneaker and apparel business is valued at $3.2 billion to $4.7 billion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The 43-year-old rapper’s sneaker and clothing business now supported by Adidas AG and Gap Inc, is valued between $3.2 billion 
                    and $4.7 billion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to Bloomberg, the music star's collaboration with Gap is set to hit stores this summer and “could be worth as much 
                    as $970 million” of the brand’s value.
                    Last year, the Grammy winner signed a 10 year agreement to design and sell apparel under the Yeezy Gap label.
                </p>
                <p>
                    West still holds total ownership and creative power within the company.
                    The father of four raked in an additional $110 million from his extensive catalog of music and has another $1.7 billion in other 
                    assets.
                </p>
                <p>
                    He also accrued $122 million in cash and stock.
                    It would be recalled that in 2020, Forbes named West as one of the highest paid celebrities of the year.
